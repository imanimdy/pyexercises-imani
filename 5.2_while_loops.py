"""Exercise 5.2 — Repeating until something changes

WHAT THE PROGRAM MUST DO
    Keep asking the user something until a condition you define is met, then display a
    summary of what happened during the loop.

ANSWER THESE FIRST, in comments at the top of your file
    1. What goes in?
    2. What happens to it?
    3. What comes out?
    4. What is your stop condition, what is your maximum number of attempts, and what
       does your summary contain?

WHAT THE AI CANNOT KNOW
    Your stop condition and your safety limit. An assistant asked for a while loop will
    write one that can run for ever if the user never gives the expected answer. Decide
    how many attempts you allow, and what your program does when that limit is reached.

    Accepting "Yes", "yes" and " yes " as the same answer is your decision too. Make it
    and write it down.

CHECK IT YOURSELF
    Run it and never give the expected answer. If your program is still running after
    your stated maximum, it is wrong. Then run it and answer with capitals and extra
    spaces.

DELIVERABLE

# 1. In: The user enters "yes" or "no" to answer a question.
# 2. Process: The program keeps asking the question until the user gives a valid answer or reaches 10 attempts.
# 3. Out: The program displays the user's answer and the total number of attempts.
# 4. My stop condition, my attempt limit, my summary: My stop condition is when the user enters "yes" or "no". The maximum number of attempts is 10.
# My summary shows the final answer which is either yes or no


# Your code below

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print("This is attempt number:", i + 1)
    i = i + 1


print("This is the end of the loop. The maximum number of attempts has been reached.")

# Your code below
while True:
   user_input = input("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
    
   if user_input == "yes":
        print("You chose to continue.")
        break
   elif user_input == "no":
        print("You chose to stop.")
        break
   else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")

print("This is the end of the loop.")
print("Total attempts:", i)
